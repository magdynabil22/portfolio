## Overview

Built AWS Spot Hub, a cloud infrastructure project that puts together everything learned during my internship at Global Brands Group. It focuses on deploying web applications using Spot Instances with auto-scaling, load balancing, and robust security â€” all running on AWS.
## Key Features

- **Spot Instance Management**: Leveraged AWS EC2 Spot Instances to optimize costs while ensuring sufficient capacity, automatically replacing instances if interrupted.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Configured auto-scaling groups to adjust the number of running instances based on real-time server load, maintaining performance during traffic spikes.
- **Load Balancing:**: ESet up Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic evenly across all instances, increasing reliability and uptime.
- **Security**: Designed strong network protection using VPC security groups, custom firewall rules, and detailed ACL configurations to tightly control access.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Integrated CloudWatch to track system health and performance, and created alerts to proactively handle issues.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2 & Spot Instances**: For scalable, cost-efficient compute power.
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: To dynamically match resources to demand.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: For traffic distribution.
- **VPC, Security Groups, ACLs**: For secure networking and access control.
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring metrics and triggering alarms.

## Challenges and Learnings

Learned how to balance cost savings with high availability by carefully configuring Spot Instances alongside auto-scaling and load balancing. Also deepened skills in setting up layered security through ACLs and security groups.
## Outcome

Created a highly available, secure, and cost-optimized AWS infrastructure that automatically scales to handle different loads, demonstrating production-ready cloud deployment practices.
