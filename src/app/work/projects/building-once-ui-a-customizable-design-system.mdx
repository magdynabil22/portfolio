## Overview

Built an AI-powered outing planner as a mobile app using Flutter for the front-end and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend. The app helps users plan personalized outings based on their interests, budget, and location.
## App Features

- **Personalized Outings**: The AI recommends a tailored outing plan for you, including places to eat and things to do based on your interests.
- **Build Your Own Plan**: You can also manually create and customize your own outing, then save or share it.
- **Quick Choices**: Browse a list of nearby restaurants and cafés, see their menus, average prices, and easily pick where to go.
- **XO Game**: Added a challenging XO (tic-tac-toe) game with maximum difficulty to keep users entertained while the AI generates their outing plan, so they don’t feel like they’re waiting.
- **Seamless Experience**: Smooth UI on Android and iOS with responsive design and easy navigation.


## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For building the mobile app.
- **Node.js & Express**: For backend services and APIs.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For storing user data in the cloud.
- **AI Tools**: Gemini and Seper.dev to power smart recommendations.

## Challenges and Learnings

Figuring out how to combine the AI with live user interactions was tricky.
## Outcome

The app is now a complete prototype that creates personalized outing plans. It’s a solid starting point for turning into a full product, helping people easily plan their perfect day out.
